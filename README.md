Okay, you have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you heard of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock? It's a fun variation of the classic game brought to popularity with a TV show called The Big Bang Theory.

The rules are very similar to the ones from the classic “Rock Paper Scissors” but with two new options, “Lizard” and “Spock”:

Scissors cut Paper.
Paper covers Rock.
Rock crushes Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.
Spock smashes Scissors.
Scissors beat Lizard.
Lizard eats Paper.
Paper disproves Spock.
Spock vaporizes Rock.
Rock breaks Scissors.
